Solving the cube blindfolded is a fun, medetative exercise. One can also use it to fool others into thinking one is special in some way. In reality, solving the cube blindfolded doesn't even require an above-average memory. All that's necessary is a solid understanding of the basic properties of the cube, and a fair bit of practice.

This article doesn't assume any knowledge of cube theory, but a reader might find some basic undergraduate math (e.g. group theory) useful.

# Preliminaries

## The Game

* I give you a cube in an arbitrary state
* You inspect the cube (the memorization phase)
* You don the blindfold
* You solve the cube (the execution phase)

We can try to optimize for different timing schemes.
That is, we could try to minimize the time of the memorization phase, the execution phase, or the game as a whole.
The method I present is tailored towards the last scheme.

## Notation

*(Someday I will add graphics to this section)*

We always consider the cube as having a fixed orientation.
Relative to a fixed orientation, the cube has 6 faces:

* `U`p
* `D`own
* `L`eft
* `R`ight
* `F`ront
* `B`ack

We can modify the state of the cube by a variety of "moves" allowed by the its mechanics.
The most basic moves correspond to clockwise turns of the 6 faces.
So, the move denoted `U` is a clockwise turn of `U` face from the perspective of looking at that face from outside of the cube.

<!-- * `U` - up
* `D` - down
* `L` - left
* `R` - right
* `F` - front
* `B` - back -->
