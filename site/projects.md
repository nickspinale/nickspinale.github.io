Haskell libraries:

*   [bigword](https://github.com/nickspinale/bigword) - Library for treating bit arrays with statically known size as heterogeneous Church-encoded vectors.
*   [bencode](https://github.com/nickspinale/bencode) - Fast and flexible parsers and builders for BEncoded data.
*   [mod-n](https://github.com/nickspinale/mod-n) - Integers under a modulus, using GHC's type-level naturals.
*   [n-vector](https://github.com/nickspinale/n-vector) - Fixed-length unboxed vectors.
*   [recall](https://github.com/nickspinale/recall) - A typeclass for memoization, based on a paper by Simon Peyton Jones.

*   [rc4](https://github.com/nickspinale/rc4) - The RC4 stream cipher implemented in pure Haskell.

Hackathon projects:

*   [git-audio](https://github.com/nickspinale/git-audio) - Allows a developer to record and play back verbal commit messages.

Fun things:

*   [TwitchPlaysPokemonGo](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchpokemongo) - A Pokemon Go playing bot that was a meme for a short period of time. Created with some 2016 [hackNY](http://hackny.org) fellows.
*   [wikipath](https://github.com/nickspinale/wikipath) - Various implementations of the 'wikipedia game' (finding the shortest path between two articles using only internal links) in both Haskell and Python.
*   [brainf--k](https://github.com/nickspinale/brainf--k) - A tiny brainf--k interpreter written in Haskell.
