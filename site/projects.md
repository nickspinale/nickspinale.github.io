# Projects

## Haskell libraries

I've worked on a number of Haskell libraries. Here is an incomplete list.

__In progress:__

*   [htorrent](https://github.com/nickspinale/htorrent) - Will someday be a full-featured BitTorrent client and library written and extensible in pure haskell.
*   [aether](https://github.com/nickspinale/aether) - A slim mainline BitTorrent distributed hashtable implementation.

__Complete:__

*   [bencode](https://github.com/nickspinale/bencode) - Fast and flexible parsers and builders for BEncoded data.
*   [bigword](https://github.com/nickspinale/bigword) - Fixed-size bit vectors using GHC's type-level naturals, useful for cryptography.
*   [mod-n](https://github.com/nickspinale/mod-n) - Integers under a modulus, using GHC's type-level naturals.
*   [n-vector](https://github.com/nickspinale/n-vector) - Fixed-length unboxed vectors.
*   [recall](https://github.com/nickspinale/recall) - A typeclass for memoization, based on a paper by Simon Peyton Jones.
*   [24-bit](https://github.com/nickspinale/24-bit) - Word24 and Int24 types, build from GHC.Prim.
*   [rc4](https://github.com/nickspinale/rc4) - The RC4 stream cipher implemented in pure Haskell.

## Hackathon projects

*   [GetGrub](https://github.com/kevinkowalew/GetGrub)
    *   An application for crowdsourcing food-related errands - connects lazy hungry people with less lazy people.
    *   Built with two frontends: iOS and the browser.

*   [targethelp](https://github.com/chetaldrich/targethelp)
    *   Allows target customers to contact employees via SMS.
    *   Messages can be dispatched to employees directly, or displayed on a central monitor.

## Other

*   [wikipath](https://github.com/nickspinale/wikipath) - Various implementations of the 'wikipedia game' (finding the shortest path between two articles using only internal links) in both Haskell and Python.
*   [brainf--k](https://github.com/nickspinale/brainf--k) - A tin brainf--k interpreter written in Haskell.
