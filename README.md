Source of my personal website, [nickspinale.com](https://nickspinale.com).

It is built with a <200 LOC hand-rolled static site generator called `./main.py`.

The design of this site is inspired by the minimalistic style of the [website](https://jaspervdj.be) of Jasper Van der Jeugt, the creator of Hakyll.
