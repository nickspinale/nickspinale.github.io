Solving the cube blindfolded isn't as hard as you'd expect.
All that's necessary is a solid understanding of the basic properties of the cube, and some practice.
This article aims to provide a detailed, in-depth explanation of one common strategy for solving the cube blindfolded.
I doesn't assume any knowledge of cube theory, but a reader will find some undergraduate math (e.g. group theory) useful.
